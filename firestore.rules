/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership security model. All application data is private and owned by a specific user. Access is granted only to the authenticated user who owns the data, ensuring complete data isolation between users.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically under a top-level `users` collection. Each user's data, including their medications and detailed dosage schedules, is nested under their unique user ID (`/users/{userId}`). This structure naturally scopes all data to its owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Path-Based Ownership: The user's ID (`userId`) in the document path is the sole source of truth for authorization. This is a highly performant and secure pattern that avoids costly database lookups (`get()` calls) in rules.
 * - No Public Data: There are no publicly readable collections. All data is private to the user who created it.
 * - No User Listing: The rules do not allow querying the top-level `/users` path, preventing anyone from listing all users of the application.
 * - Default Deny: The default security posture is to deny all access. Rules explicitly grant permissions on a per-collection basis.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: This ruleset relies on the path structure itself as a form of denormalization. By placing a user's data under `/users/{userId}/...`, we implicitly stamp every document with an owner ID, making ownership checks simple and fast.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The entire data model follows this principle. All private user data is segregated into a user-specific document tree, which is inherently more secure and performant for queries than mixing private and public data in a single collection.
