## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0CFFA), associated with trustworthiness and health.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), provides a calm, clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Light green (#90EE90) to indicate positive actions or confirmation, analogous to the primary, creating contrast to ensure legibility.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' for headlines and 'PT Sans' for body text. Inter is a sans-serif (grotesque) for headlines and PT Sans (humanist sans-serif) offers a modern look and feel.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different medications or actions (e.g., a pill icon for medication, a checkmark for marking a dosage as taken).
- Design a clean, intuitive layout for easy navigation and readability. Use clear visual hierarchy to emphasize important information (e.g., dosage times, medication names).
- Incorporate subtle animations or transitions to provide feedback and enhance the user experience (e.g., a gentle fade-in when a new dosage is added, a subtle highlight when a dosage is marked as taken).
